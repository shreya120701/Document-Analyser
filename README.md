# Document-Analyser

Problem statement:
In our day-to-day life, data is being generated at incredible speed and volume. With this existing speed of data, it is really difficult to analyse the contents inside. 
At this point, there is a need to have a tool to analyze the data in the form of documents. The tool "Document analyser" can analyze the documents, emails, web pages, text files etc.
Using this tool, we can analyse the contents of documents based on our interest and then act at our own wish. 
Quantifying user’s idea, thoughts and opinions helps business people to target audience and create innovative products and services.
It's not limited to business, it can also be used in research, security and many more.
